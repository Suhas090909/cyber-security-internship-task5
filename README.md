Network Traffic Capture &amp; Analysis 
Task 5: Network Traffic Capture & Analysis Report
Name: SUHAS MHASKE
Tool Used: Wireshark
Capture File: task5.pcapng
1.	Objective
To capture live network packets and analyze basic protocols observed in the traffic.
2.	Summary of Traffic Captured
Packets were captured while browsing websites and performing ICMP ping tests. The capture includes DNS, TCP, HTTP/HTTPS, and ICMP traffic.
3.	Identified Protocols
A. DNS (Domain Name System) - Used for resolving domain names.
- Observed queries for common domains.
B. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - Reliable transport layer protocol.
- Multiple TCP handshakes and data transfer packets observed.
C. HTTP/HTTPS
-	Web browsing traffic.
-	Includes GET/POST requests and encrypted TLS packets.
D. ICMP
-	Generated from ping commands.
-	Includes Echo Request and Reply packets.
4. Packet Details (General Summary)
-	Source and destination IPs vary depending on browsing and ping operations.
-	Packet lengths ranged from small DNS queries to larger TCP segments.
-	Info fields confirm successful DNS resolutions and HTTP/TLS handshakes.
5. Conclusion
Wireshark successfully captured real-time traffic. Multiple protocols were identified and analyzed, demonstrating the flow of data across the network and understanding of basic packet structures.
